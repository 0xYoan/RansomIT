# RansomIT

> Encrypt files with keys generated by ED25519 algorithm.

[![LICENSE][license-image]][license-url]

## Introduction

This project was developed during my internship in cybersecurity. The goal was to make a simple python ransomware to test its propagation in a cloud environment. The RansomIT program encrypts files using a key pair generated with the ED25519 algorithm.

## Installation

OS X & Linux & Windows:

```python
git clone https://github.com/0xYoan/RansomIT.git
cd RansomIT
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Encryption

1. Open code and change **TARGET_PATH** constant. This is the starting point of the encryption. *`BE CAREFUL WITH THIS, IT CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR SYSTEM !`*

2. Simply run the code : `python3 RansomIT.py`.
3. Copy generated ID somewhere to decrypt files later.
4. All done !

Example of ID:

```plaintext
Your ID : e28b951c-5f1d-45fd-93a4-648007bc5066
```

### Decryption

1. Open code and change **TARGET_PATH** constant. This is the starting point of the decryption.

2. Simply run the code : `python3 DeRansomIT.py`.
3. Paste ID to decrypt files.
4. All done !

## TODO

- Add multithreading
- Manage keys with VPS and SFTP
- Test on other platforms
- More features...
